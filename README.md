## About

LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding skills through various programming challenges. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these challenges, along with explanations and comments to help understand the thought process behind each solution.

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty and topic, making it easy to navigate and find solutions of interest. Each problem is contained within its own directory, with the following structure:

/ProblemName
├── solution.ext
├── README.md
└── testcases/


- `solution.ext`: This file contains the implementation of the solution in a specific programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- `README.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the problem statement, approach used, time and space complexity analysis, and any other relevant details.
- `testcases/`: Contains test cases used to validate the correctness of the solution.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an alternative solution to a problem, optimizations, or new problems to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the repository's coding standards and includes comprehensive documentation.
